#### Class 6: Input Devices
  
 In class, on Tuesday the 11th, we learned about several different sensors, input devices, and coding techniques. Using the data and code provided on the class website, I was able to build working circuits for heat sensors and light sensors.
<p>
For the first part of the class assignment, I attempted to calibrate a magnetic field sensor. I started by wiring the circuit from the course website. Then I wrote the code below to read the signal from the hall sensor. When trying to calibrate the maximum and minimum of the sensor, I discovered that it is quite sensitive for distances above 1 mm and less than 9 mm. According to the data table below, the practical range is around 2 to 8 mm. </p>

<p>
   <pre><code class="language-arduino">
     void setup(){
 Serial.begin(9600);
}
   // read the value given 
 void loop(){
  int val = analogRead(A0);  // read Hall sensor value
 }
 </code></pre>

  <p>For the second part of my input device assignment, I decided to build my own capacitive throttle sensor. I used two popsicle sticks, two pieces of copper sticker, foam, masking tape, and wires. First, I stuck wires onto the two piece of copper and then on the popsicle sticks, sandwiching the wires to the sticks. Then, I taped the popsicle sticks together on the opposite side, having the copper sheets facing each other (tape on one end, copper on the other). Next, I pushed a piece of foam between the popsicle sticks as close to the tape as possible. This separated the popsicle sticks giving me enough room to tape another piece of foam between the two copper sheets. Finally, I plugged in the code, and I had myself a throttle!! </p>

</p>
  
  <p>To calibrate the minimum and maximum of my sensor, I hooked up the throttle to my Arduino Uno. From there I conducted 2 trials. In both trials, I added the stated grams of pressure and compared it to the serial plotter, taking the average for each point. Finally, I concluded that the closer the popsicle sticks press the copper together, the higher the signal it reads.</p>

    Serial.begin(9600);

    Serial.println(result);

                      // that depends on coupling of two electrodes.

  int N_samples = 100;    // Number of samples to take.  Larger number slows it down, but reduces scatter.

  sum = 0;

  for (int i = 0; i < N_samples; i++){
   digitalWrite(tx_pin,HIGH);              // Step the voltage high on conductor 1.
   read_high = analogRead(analog_pin);     // Measure response of conductor 2.
   delayMicroseconds(100);                 // Delay to reach steady state.
   digitalWrite(tx_pin,LOW);               // Step the voltage to zero on conductor 1.
   read_low = analogRead(analog_pin);      // Measure response of conductor 2.
   diff = read_high - read_low;            // desired answer is the difference between high and low.
   sum += diff;                            // Sums up N_samples of these measurements.
 }
  return sum;
}                                          // End of tx_rx function.
