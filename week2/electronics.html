#### Class 3: Electronics and Kinetic Sculpture
  
 In my class on Tuesday 27th, I was taught basic circuitry. I learned how to construct and manipulate a circuit using an Arduino Uno, a bread board, resistors, LEDs, motors, etc. Afterwards in labs, I used a tinkering kit for learning mechanics. Once I figured out the basics of both, I was able to start on my kinetic sculpture.

<p>My first idea for a kinetic sculpture was to make an animal or a man walk. I first started with a model found through the course website. From there, I used trial and error to reconstruct a simplified version using the tinker kits. I made a mirror image to the legs on the other side of the board; however, I staggered the timing to get the illusion of walking. </p>

<p>After building the basic model, I started designing the supports for the sculpture and motor. I took careful measurements, making sure everything would fit together. Then, after much consideration, I decided that my sculpture would look more natural if the supports were made into a bike shape. So instead of a walking man, I now had my creation, Bike Man. </p>

<p>On Friday, I attempted to move my ideas over to Fusion to laser cut them. However, I had a few technical difficulties, and had to take some supplies home over the weekend instead. During my weekend, I hand measured and cut out many different designs for Mr. Bike Man. Mr. Bike Man is made entirely out of cardboard minus the motor and wires. While testing my sculpture, I had trouble keeping my gears connected to my motor, so I did eventually end up taping that one part. However, I will ideally fix that later. After many hours of work, I finish the first prototype of Mr. Bike Man.</p>

<p>When the it opened again on Monday, I took Mr. Bike Man into the lab and added some finishing touches such as wheels, handle bars, and a pipe cleaner man with a hat. Finally, I plugged him into an Arduino Uno, then into my computer, and he could officially bike forwards. </p>
