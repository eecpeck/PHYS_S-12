#### Class 5: 3D Design, Printing, and Scanning
  
For my 3D-printing assignment, I decided to create a hinge shape that I would need for my final project. I was very hesitant to create this shape because I did not know how well the 3D-printer would be able to handle it, but I went ahead and attempted it anyways. First, I sketched out the basic design in Fusion 360. (circle = 10mm, total length = 20mm)<a download href='../pictures/My_hinge.f3d'>Download my hinge f3d file!
