#### Class 5: 3D Design, Printing, and Scanning
  
For my 3D-printing assignment, I decided to create a hinge shape that I would need for my final project. I was very hesitant to create this shape because I did not know how well the 3D-printer would be able to handle it, but I went ahead and attempted it anyways. First, I sketched out the basic design in Fusion 360. (circle = 10mm, total length = 20mm)

<p>Next, I added a 5mm circle on one sketch and a 4.5mm circle on the other. </p>
  <p>

<p>I had the basic sketch complete so then I extruded the center part of the hinge by 5mm (the side with the 5mm hole in the center). Then, I extruded the other sketch by 2mm and the 4.5mm center by 6mm. After that, I mirrored the sketch on the other side to create the fork-like shape below. </p>

<p>Once I had both shapes complete, I moved them together and submitted the hinge to the 3D-printer. </p>

<p>My hinge took about 15 minutes to print, and it turned out surprisingly well! The hinge had an entire 360 degrees of rotation without separation, getting stuck, or breaking. Here is the file for my hinge.</p>

####RevoPoint Scanning
<p>After finishing the 3D-printing assignment, I moved on to the RevoPoint Scanner. I placed a sculpture found in the lab on the spinning platform and allowed the camera to scan it. From there, I used the Fill Holes function. This fixed the gaps in the scan, and I had myself a head.
