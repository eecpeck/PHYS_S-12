#### My Project Proposals 
  
  In this seven-week course, I have two different possible ideas that root from the same cause. In an effort to make my project personal, I have decided to build a machine that helps my mom with her daily life. My mom has Multiple Sclerosis. This auto immune disease attacks her immune system, nervous system, and cognitive abilities. While I may not be able to help her immune system, I have a couple devices in mind to aid in walking and memory. 

  <p>The first project I thought of was a walking stabilizer. Walking is the one thing my mom refuses to give up on, so I want to give her the chance to walk for as long as possible. In this project, I would be creating a sort of exoskeleton that straps around the waist and hinges at the hip and knee. The device would be programed so that when an individual leans forward (or maybe presses a button) the exoskeleton will move the legs to make that person walk forward. The femur and calf sections will both hopefully be adjustable in length so they could be adjusted to any person. Below are a few similar images that I want my project to look and function like.</p>

 <p>The other project that I am considering is an automated pill box. Since it is not uncommon for my mom to accidently take her morning meds at night, or even forgot if she took them at all, I want to built a pill box that will release the right number of meds at the right time of day. I would build a box with compartments for each medicine. Then, I would create a mechanism to dispense the correct number of pills. I would also need to put a timer on it to dispense in the mornings and evenings. </p>
