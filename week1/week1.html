#### My Project Proposals 
  
  In this seven-week course, I have decided to create a prototype for a walking device. I want to build a machine that helps my mom with her daily life. My mom has Multiple Sclerosis. This autoimmune disease attacks her nervous system and affects her cognitive abilities and immune system. While I may not be able to help her immune system, a prototype for this device might help her walk for years to come. 

  <p>My oringinal idea was a walking stabilizer. Walking is the one thing my mom refuses to give up, so I want to give her the chance to walk for as long as possible. In this project, I would be creating a prototype for an exoskeleton that straps around the waist and hinges at the hip and knee. The device would be programmed so that when an individual leans forward (or maybe presses a button) the exoskeleton will move the legs to make that person walk forward. The femur and calf sections will ideally be adjustable in length so they can be adjusted to any person. Shown below are a few similar images to how I want my project to look and function.</p>

 <p>After a bit of research into my project, I came to the conclusion that it was outside the scope of this class. I have decided to scale down my prototype to a singular prothetic leg still attached to the hip. Also, the size will be deceased so I can 3D-print the required braces. I am using a robot arm found in the lab as an example for my final project. It has a similar set up to what I was considering. While it may be slightly different, I am sure I will be able to translate it into my prototype. </p>
  <p>Required Materials:</p>
  <p>3D-printed braces</p>
  <p>hinge pieces</p>
  <p>2 motors</p>

  <p>Expected timeline: 4-5 weeks</p>
  <p>1 week for printing</p>
  <p>1 week for construction</p>
  <p>2 weeks for coding</p>
