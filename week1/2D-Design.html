#### Class 2 - 2D Design and Cutting
  
 During my labs on June 22, I designed and constructed a press-fit hexagonal pencil holder. My first few designs were extremely complicated. So, after much consideration, I decided to use something I had previously designed to compensate for my lack of knowledge on a laser cutter. I first drew my design on paper to make sure I had the correct plans. Then, I reconstructed the pencil holder on a website named Shapr3D. From there, I took the plans to the laser cutter. After cutting out my design, the pieces fit together perfectly. However, my height dimensions were slightly off. My pencil holder was shorter than I imagined it would be. While I am still getting used to using the metric system, my ability in understanding it is improving every day. Here are the plans and final outcome of my press-fit pencil holder.

<p>Over my weekend, I spent numerous hours learning how to 3D design a fork and a book. First, I downloaded Shapr 3D and played around with the software, trying my best to figure out how it worked. Then, I took measurements of both my fork and my book. (Fork: top-width = 25mm, top-handle = 9mm, bottom-handle = 14mm, tongs = 3mm, between-tongs = 3mm) (Book: height-cover = 205mm, cover-width = 140mm, height-page: 195mm, page-width = 130mm, spine-height = 201mm) After measuring, I drew the basic layout of each object on a flat plane. From there I raised the shapes to their correct heights. </p> 
  
<p>For the fork, I drew a separate layout of the side view. I then cut the side view out of the original shape, therefore giving me the desired fork appearance. Finally, I cut out the tines and rounded the edges, and my fork looked like something I would use in everyday life.  </p>

<p>For my book, I had to raise each section (pages, spine, etc.) separately and piece it back together one shape at a time. After accomplishing that, I thought my book looked somewhat dull, so I decided to add a page in the midst of being turned. This one detail brought my creation to life. </p>
