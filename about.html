### About Me:
  Hi, my name is Emory Peck. I am a rising senior in high school, and I am homeschooled in South Alabama. I love inventing, designing, and building new things that have real world applications. My dream job is to become an Imagineer for the Walt Disney World Company. I want to bring the fairytales from my childhood to life. I want to be able to walk through and experience them as if I am in the story itself. Along with that, I also play softball, I dance, and I preform in the circus arts. In softball, I am a part of a travel ball team, and I also play for my local high school. My primary positions are catcher and outfield, but I am decent at infield as well. As a dancer, I am proficient in Ballet and Modern, nevertheless my favorites will always be Jazz and Hip-Hop. Probably my most interesting hobby is circus. I have done a little bit of everything (like trampoline, teeterboard, straps, etc.) but I am best at aerial silks, lyra, and flying trapeze.
