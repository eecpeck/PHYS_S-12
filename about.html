### About Me:
  Hi, my name is Emory Peck. I am a class of '24 senior in high school, and I am homeschooled in South Alabama. I love inventing, designing, and building new things that have real world applications. My dream job is to become an Imagineer for the Walt Disney Company. I want to bring the fairytales from my childhood to life. I want to be able to walk through and experience them as if I am in the story itself. When I am not inventing or doing my homework, I play softball, I dance, and I perform in the circus arts. I play softball for both my local high school and a travel team that plays throughout the Southeast. My primary positions are catcher and outfield, but I can hold my own in the infield as well. As a dancer, I enjoy Ballet and Modern, but my favorites will always be Jazz and Hip-Hop. Probably my most unique hobby is circus. I have trained with Cirque du Soleil in Las Vagas and have done a little bit of everything (like trampoline, teeterboard, straps, etc.) but I am best at aerial silks, lyra, and flying trapeze.
