#### Class 8: Milling, Molding, Casting
  
 On the 18th, we learned how operate CNC tools, such as the ShopBot and Shaper, and how to create something by molding and casting. 
<p>
For the first assignment, I drew a bat (my favorite animal) with a 94mm wing span using Fusion 360 and then exported the file to the hand-held Shaper. To control the Shaper, I had to lay down this barcoded tape in strips across the piece of plywood I was milling. Then, once I had the shaper turned on and connected to the vacuum, I was able to select my design from the USB Drive and resize it to fit the plywood. I decided to cut out my bat shape twice as big as originally designed because I did not know how much kerf to account for. While all in all the Shaper was fairly accurate, I figured out that if I moved it too fast or if it got too far away from the tape, the Shaper would starting jumping around, cutting a little too far into the design. </p>

  <p>The molding and casting part of the assignment took several days to complete. During the labs on the 18th, I 3D-modeled the silhouette of a pair of pointe shoes. The square around the silhouette is 6mm deep while the pointe shoe shape is extruded 4mm. Then, I exported my design to the SRM-20 Mill, and I taped a block of wax onto the bed for milling. I also changed the bit on the machine and calibrated the xyz-axis. Once the machine was done cutting, I waited 5 seconds before removing the wax. I cleaned the mold out and I had a perfect pointe shoe mold!</p>

  <p>The second step, and by far the longest, was creating the silicone mold. I went into the lab before class on Thursday, and I pulled out the clear silicone mixture. I poured equal amounts of both Part A and Part B into a cup and I mixed thoroughly. Next, I poured the mixture in the wax silhouette, letting it then sit for the next 6 hours. By the end of labs, the silicone mixture had completely set, and my mold was finished.</p>

<p>For the last step, I decided I wanted to make an aluminum pointe shoe charm. So, I melted the metal in the microwave toaster on the pizza setting for about 5 minutes. Once it had melted, I poured the metal into the silicone mold. I quickly scrapped off the excess before it hardened and waited for it to cool. After removing the pointe shoes from the mold, I realized the edges were quite sharp and the over all finish was bubbly. To clean up the charm, I filed and sanded the edges until it was smooth and shiny. Finally, I had a tiny pair of pointe shoes!!</p>
